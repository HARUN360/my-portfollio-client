      I am Md. Harun Or Roshid, a passionate and dedicated junior web developer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. With a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I specialize in creating user-friendly and responsive web applications that solve real-world problems.

      My journey in web development began during my diploma studies at Sherpur Polytechnic, where I discovered my love for coding and building web projects. Over time, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Node.js. My experience with version control systems like Git, along with deployment platforms like Netlify and Heroku, has equipped me with the tools to manage and deliver high-quality web solutions.

      I take pride in my ability to write clean, efficient code and my commitment to continuous learning. My best project, 'ContestHub,' showcases my ability to design and implement complex systems that are both functional and user-centric. This project involved creating a platform where users can participate in various contests, with a focus on role management, secure data handling, and seamless user experience.

      I am always eager to take on new challenges, work on innovative projects, and collaborate with other talented professionals. My goal is to contribute to the web development community by building applications that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also technically robust.

      When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with the latest trends in web development. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your next project.
